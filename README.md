# Bijoy Layout for Avro Keyboard

This project provides a **Bijoy-style keyboard layout** for use with **Avro Keyboard**, enabling users familiar with the classic Bijoy typing method to type in Bengali using the modern, open-source Avro Keyboard.

## 📌 Overview

- **Bijoy** is a widely used Bengali typing standard in Bangladesh, known for its phonetic and intuitive key mappings.
- **Avro Keyboard** is a free and open-source Bengali input method that supports multiple layouts (e.g., Avro Phonetic, Bornona, etc.).
- This layout bridges the gap by adding **Bijoy key mapping** as a selectable layout inside Avro Keyboard.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

4. Click **Import** and select the downloaded `.avro` layout file.
